Cloud computing, often called simply "the cloud," involves delivering data, applications, photos, videos, and more over the Internet to data centers. IBM has helpfully broken down cloud computing into six different categories:
Software as a service (SaaS): Cloud-based applications run on computers off site (or "in the cloud"). Other people or companies own and operate these devices, which connect to users' computers, typically through a web browser.
Platform as a service (PaaS): Here, the cloud houses everything necessary to build and deliver cloud-based applications. This removes the need to purchase and maintain hardware, software, hosting, and more.
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): IaaS provides companies with servers, storage, networking, and data centers on a per-use basis.
Public Cloud: Companies own and operate these spaces and provide quick access to users over a public network.
Private Cloud: Similar to a public cloud, except only one entity (user, organization, company, etc.) has access.
Hybrid Cloud: Takes the foundation of a private cloud but provides public cloud access.
The Internet of Things, meanwhile, refers to the connection of devices (other than the usual examples such as computers and smartphones) to the Internet. Cars, kitchen appliances, and even heart monitors can all be connected through the IoT. And as the Internet of Things surges in the coming years, more devices will join that list.
The Internet of Things and cloud computing are different, but each will have their own job in tackling this new world of data.
