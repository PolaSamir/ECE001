The Internet of Things or IoT for short refers to the billions of physical devices around the world that are now connected to the internet, 
all collecting and transfaring data between eachother. Thanks to the arrival of super-cheap computer chips and the easy accsess to wireless networks, 
it's possible to turn anything, from something as small as a pill to something as big as a building, 
into a part of the IoT. Connecting up all these different objects and adding sensors to them adds a level of digital intelligence to devices, 
enabling them to communicate in real-time without involving of a human being. The Internet of Things is making the fabric of the world around us more smarter and more responsive, 
merging the digital and physical universes.
